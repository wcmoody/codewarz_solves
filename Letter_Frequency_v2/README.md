# Letter_Frequency_v2

# Description

<p>We showed our boss the orginal letter freq challenge and he said it looked like a 5th grader designed it. He wants to see percent signs and sorting that makes much more sense. Write a program to mimic the example output below. <strong>Note:</strong> Notice anything in particular on how it's sorted? Also don't worry about counting/printing the punctuation or newlines.</p>

## Sample Input:

```
$ cat samplefile
abcdefg hiabcd
D DD
```
## Expected Output:

```
$ ./solve.py /path/to/samplefile
'd' 27.78%
' ' 11.11%
'a' 11.11%
'b' 11.11%
'c' 11.11%
'e' 5.56%
'f' 5.56%
'g' 5.56%
'h' 5.56%
'i' 5.56%
```
## Expected SHA1 Hash:

```
d7d855a305d04698620660e977ee7ae78153a4ca
```
