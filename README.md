## Codewarz / Runcode Solves

During my time at the US Military Academy teaching Computer Science (2015-2019), I competed in the programming competition site Runcode.ninja (previously know as Codewarz). Read more about Runcode here: https://docs.runcode.ninja/

Here is my repositiory of solves, primarily in Python2 but a few C solves. At one point when there was about 140 total challenges, I was the only person to have solved all challenges and was number 1 on the scoreboard. This was when only US Army connected individuals had accounts.

Each challenge is represented as a folder that contains a ReadMe describing the challenge, a text file of the sample input, and a python and/or C file with my solve.

Enjoy.
