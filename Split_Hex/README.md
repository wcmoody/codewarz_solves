# Split_Hex

# Description

<p>It appears this guy wrote a broken hex generator, instead of printing the hex representation as normal it's split on two lines. Can you stick the lines together and decode the hex?
</p>

## Sample Input:

$ cat /path/to/input.txt
46627672666666276672667766630
31e09f50453f45048930d533175fa
```
## Expected Output:

```
$ ./split.pl /path/to/input.txt
Can you decode this message?
```
## Expected SHA1 Hash:

```
