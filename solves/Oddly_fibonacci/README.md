# Oddly_fibonacci

# Description

<p>This Italian guy in 1202 decided to come up with this sequence of numbers that starts with 0 and 1 and the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). However we don't like that guy and his shady ideas. We only care about the odd numbers in his sequence. We need you to create a list of fibonacci numbers, use the two numbers provided as input to the problem as the start and stop for the fibonacci numbers in the sequence (these are the only numbers you are working with) and add only the odd ones together and print their total sum.

## Sample Input:

```
$ cat /path/to/somefile.txt
10 20
```
## Expected Output:

```
$ ./oddly_fibonacci_solve.py /path/to/somefile.txt
7519
```
## Expected SHA1 Hash:

```
