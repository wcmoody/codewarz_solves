# Leet_speak_decoder

# Description

<p>The path to the input file will be passed into your program as a command line argument when your program is called.<br/><br/>
<strong>Admin Note:</strong> On the server the english dictionary file is located at /usr/share/dict/american-english<br/><br/>
So your program can use that file path location in your uploaded program
<br/><br/>
You need develop a program to decode some l33t sp3@k words. It seems this guy developed his own l33t speak language to encode some of his words. Not all of his words are encoded and also seems that some of his words are backwards, and possibly backwards and encoded. You only need to print the words that are valid english dictionary <a href="https://codewarz.ninja/static/downloads/american-english.txt">(/usr/share/dict/american-english)</a> words after decoding. Below is a sample test set of data that we found on his machine that he used for his testing. Your program should be able to exactly reproduce his output based on his input data.<br/><br/>
