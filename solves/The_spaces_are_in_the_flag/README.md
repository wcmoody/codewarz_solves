# The_spaces_are_in_the_flag

# Description

<p>The path to the input file will be passed into your program as a command line argument when your program is called.<br/><br/>
Given the following string and it's corresponding output, write the decode function.
As an aside, the original string is encoded twice. And, in case this problem wasn't easy enough, the string will only consist of lower case characters and punctuation (although some punctuation serves a different purpose).
