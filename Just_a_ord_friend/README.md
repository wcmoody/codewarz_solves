# Description

<p>While taking a college programming class, your instructor just taught you about ordinal values. You need to take the sample file and add up the total sum of ordinal values of characters upper and lowercase, but not anything else.</p>

## Sample Input:

```
$ cat sample.txt
So I took blah - blah's word for it at this time
 I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
  'Cause I have  friends and that's a fact
 Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about    that, let's go into the story
 About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
  So we         started talkin', getttin' familiar
   Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
    A relationship or some understanding
   How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
  Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
 I had no idea  I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
 The tour was over and she went back to school
  I called every day to see how she was doin'
   Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
    I called her on my dime, picked up, and then I called again
   I said, yo, who was that? Oh, he's just a friend
  Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust       this
```
## Expected Output:
