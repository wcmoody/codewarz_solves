So I took blah - blah's word for it at this tim
 I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crim
  'Cause I have  friends and that's a fact
 Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about    that, let's go into the story
 About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored m
  So we         started talkin', getttin' familia
   Spendin' a lot of time so we can build u
    A relationship or some understanding
   How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
  Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
 I had no idea  I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
 The tour was over and she went back to school
  I called every day to see how she was doin'
   Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
    I called her on my dime, picked up, and then I called again
   I said, yo, who was that? Oh, he's just a friend
  Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust       this
