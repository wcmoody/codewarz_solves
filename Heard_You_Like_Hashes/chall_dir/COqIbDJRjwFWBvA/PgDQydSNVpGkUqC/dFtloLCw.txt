I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
A love no one could deny
We kissed, I fell under your spell
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
