All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
And instead of using force
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
