I never hit so hard in love
A love no one could deny
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
