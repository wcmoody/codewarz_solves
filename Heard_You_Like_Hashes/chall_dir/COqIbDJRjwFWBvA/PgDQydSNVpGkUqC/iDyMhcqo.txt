I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
