I put you high up in the sky
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
A love no one could deny
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you, you wreck me
