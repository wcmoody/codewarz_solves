We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
