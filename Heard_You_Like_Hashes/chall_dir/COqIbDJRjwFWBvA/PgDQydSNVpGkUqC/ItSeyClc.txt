Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
