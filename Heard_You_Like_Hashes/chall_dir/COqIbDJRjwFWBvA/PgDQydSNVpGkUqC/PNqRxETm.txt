All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Donâ€™t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
