I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
