All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And instead of using force
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
