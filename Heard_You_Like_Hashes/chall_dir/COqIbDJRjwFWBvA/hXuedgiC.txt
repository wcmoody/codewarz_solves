Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
