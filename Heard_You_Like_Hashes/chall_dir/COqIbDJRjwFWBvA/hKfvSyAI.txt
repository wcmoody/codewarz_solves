A love no one could deny
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
