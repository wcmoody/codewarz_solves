I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
We jumped, never asking why
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
