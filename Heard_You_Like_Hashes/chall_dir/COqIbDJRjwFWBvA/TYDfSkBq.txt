We jumped, never asking why
I guess I should’ve let you in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
