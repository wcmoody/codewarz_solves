I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And instead of using force
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
We jumped, never asking why
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
