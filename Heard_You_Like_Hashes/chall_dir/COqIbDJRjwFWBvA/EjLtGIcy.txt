All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
