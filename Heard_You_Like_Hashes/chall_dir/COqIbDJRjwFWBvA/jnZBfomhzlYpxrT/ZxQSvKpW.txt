All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
