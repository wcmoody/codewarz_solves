Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
