Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
And instead of using force
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I never meant to start a war
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
