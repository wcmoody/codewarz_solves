We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
A love no one could deny
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
And instead of using force
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
