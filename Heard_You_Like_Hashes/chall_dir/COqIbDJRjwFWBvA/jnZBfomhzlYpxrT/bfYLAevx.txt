All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
