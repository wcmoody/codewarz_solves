I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
And instead of using force
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
