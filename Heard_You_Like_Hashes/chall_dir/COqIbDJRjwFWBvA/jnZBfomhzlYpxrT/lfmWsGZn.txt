Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
Donâ€™t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
