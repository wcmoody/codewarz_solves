I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never meant to start a war
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
A love no one could deny
And instead of using force
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
