I guess I should’ve let you in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
