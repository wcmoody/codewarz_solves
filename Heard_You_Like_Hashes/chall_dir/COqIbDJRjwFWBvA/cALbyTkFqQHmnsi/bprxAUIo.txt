All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
A love no one could deny
I guess I should’ve let you in
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
