Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And instead of using force
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
