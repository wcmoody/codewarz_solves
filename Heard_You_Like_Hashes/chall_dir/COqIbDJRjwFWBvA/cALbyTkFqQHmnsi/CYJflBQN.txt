I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And instead of using force
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
