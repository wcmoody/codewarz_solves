All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I put you high up in the sky
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
And instead of using force
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
