Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
And instead of using force
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
And now, youâ€™re not coming down
