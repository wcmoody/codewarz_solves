Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I put you high up in the sky
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
