I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
