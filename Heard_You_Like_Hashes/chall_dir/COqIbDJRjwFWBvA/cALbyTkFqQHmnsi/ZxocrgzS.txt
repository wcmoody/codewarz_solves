All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
A love no one could deny
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
It slowly turned, you let me burn
