I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
And instead of using force
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
