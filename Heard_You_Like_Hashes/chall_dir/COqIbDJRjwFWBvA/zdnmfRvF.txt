All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
I put you high up in the sky
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
