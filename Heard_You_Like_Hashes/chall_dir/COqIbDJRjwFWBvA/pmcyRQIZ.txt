All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
