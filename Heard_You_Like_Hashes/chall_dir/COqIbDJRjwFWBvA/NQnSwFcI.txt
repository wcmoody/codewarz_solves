All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall

I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
