And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
