I never hit so hard in love
A love no one could deny
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I put you high up in the sky
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
And instead of using force
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
