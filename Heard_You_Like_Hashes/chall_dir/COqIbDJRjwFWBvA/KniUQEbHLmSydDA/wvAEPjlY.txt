Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, you’re not coming down
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
