Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
A love no one could deny
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
