I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
We jumped, never asking why
