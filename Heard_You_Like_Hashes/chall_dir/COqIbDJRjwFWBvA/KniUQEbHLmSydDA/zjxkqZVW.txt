All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
And instead of using force
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I guess I should’ve let you in
A love no one could deny
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
