I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I put you high up in the sky
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
