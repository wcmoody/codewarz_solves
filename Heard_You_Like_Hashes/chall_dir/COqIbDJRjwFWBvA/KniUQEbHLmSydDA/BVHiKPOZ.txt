I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Donâ€™t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
