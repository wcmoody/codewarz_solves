Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
And instead of using force
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
And now, you’re not coming down
