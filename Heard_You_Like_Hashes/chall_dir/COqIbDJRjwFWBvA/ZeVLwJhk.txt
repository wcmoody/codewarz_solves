I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you wreck me
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you, you wreck me
