I guess I should’ve let you in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
