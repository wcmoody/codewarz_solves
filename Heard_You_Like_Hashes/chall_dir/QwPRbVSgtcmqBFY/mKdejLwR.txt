All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
A love no one could deny
We jumped, never asking why
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
