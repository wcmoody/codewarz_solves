I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
And instead of using force
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
I just wanted you to let me in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
