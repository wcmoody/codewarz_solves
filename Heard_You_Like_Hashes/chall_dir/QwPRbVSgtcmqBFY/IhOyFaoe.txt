I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And instead of using force
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
