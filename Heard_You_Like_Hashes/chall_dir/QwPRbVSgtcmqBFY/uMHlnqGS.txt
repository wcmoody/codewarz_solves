Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
