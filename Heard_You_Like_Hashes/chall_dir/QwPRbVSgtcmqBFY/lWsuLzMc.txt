Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
