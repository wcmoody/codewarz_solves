All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
And instead of using force
A love no one could deny
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
