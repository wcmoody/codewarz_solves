I guess I should’ve let you in
A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
