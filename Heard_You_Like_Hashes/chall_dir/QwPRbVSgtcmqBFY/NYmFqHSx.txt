Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
