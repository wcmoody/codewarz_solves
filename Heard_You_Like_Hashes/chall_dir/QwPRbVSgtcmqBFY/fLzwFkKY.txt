I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
