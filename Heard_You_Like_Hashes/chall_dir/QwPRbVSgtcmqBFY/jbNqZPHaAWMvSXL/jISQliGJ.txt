And now, you’re not coming down
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
