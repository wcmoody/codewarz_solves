All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
