We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
