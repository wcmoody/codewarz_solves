I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
