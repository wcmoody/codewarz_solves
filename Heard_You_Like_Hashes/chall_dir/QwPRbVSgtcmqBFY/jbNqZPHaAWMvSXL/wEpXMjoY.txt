I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
We jumped, never asking why
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
