All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
