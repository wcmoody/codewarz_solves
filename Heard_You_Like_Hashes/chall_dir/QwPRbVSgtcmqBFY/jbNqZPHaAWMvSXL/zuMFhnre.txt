Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
