All I wanted was to break your walls
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
