I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I guess I should’ve let you in
