We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
