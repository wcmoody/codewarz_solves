I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And instead of using force
And now, you’re not coming down
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
