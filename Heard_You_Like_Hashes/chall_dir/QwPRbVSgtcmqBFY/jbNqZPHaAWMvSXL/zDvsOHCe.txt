I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
I never meant to start a war
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
