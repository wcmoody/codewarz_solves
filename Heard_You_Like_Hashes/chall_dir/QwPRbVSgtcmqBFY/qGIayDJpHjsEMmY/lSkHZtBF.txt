All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you, you wreck me
