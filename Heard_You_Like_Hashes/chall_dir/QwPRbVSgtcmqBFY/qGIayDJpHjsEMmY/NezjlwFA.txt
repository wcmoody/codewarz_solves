Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
