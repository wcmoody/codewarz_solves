I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
