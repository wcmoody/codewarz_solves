All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
And instead of using force
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
I just wanted you to let me in
