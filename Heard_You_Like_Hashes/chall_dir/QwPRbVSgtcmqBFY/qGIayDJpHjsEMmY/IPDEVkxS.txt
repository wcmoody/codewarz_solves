I can’t live a lie, running for my life
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never meant to start a war
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
