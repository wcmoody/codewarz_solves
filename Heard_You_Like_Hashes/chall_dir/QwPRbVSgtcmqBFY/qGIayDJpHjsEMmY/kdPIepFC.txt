I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
And instead of using force
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
