I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
Donâ€™t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
