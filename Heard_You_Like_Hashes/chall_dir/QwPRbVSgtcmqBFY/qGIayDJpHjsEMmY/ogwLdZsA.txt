All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And now, weâ€™re ashes on the ground
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
