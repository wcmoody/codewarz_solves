I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
