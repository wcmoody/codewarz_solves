I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I guess I should’ve let you in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
