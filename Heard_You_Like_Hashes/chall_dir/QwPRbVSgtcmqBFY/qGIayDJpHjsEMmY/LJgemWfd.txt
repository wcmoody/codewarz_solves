All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
