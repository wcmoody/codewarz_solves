Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, weâ€™re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
