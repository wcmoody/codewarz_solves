Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
