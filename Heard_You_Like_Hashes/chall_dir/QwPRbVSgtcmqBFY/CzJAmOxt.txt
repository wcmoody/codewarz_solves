I never meant to start a war
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
I guess I should’ve let you in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We jumped, never asking why
