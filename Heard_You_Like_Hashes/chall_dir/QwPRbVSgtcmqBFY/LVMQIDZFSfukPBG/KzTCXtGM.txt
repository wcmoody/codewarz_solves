I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
A love no one could deny
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
And instead of using force
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
