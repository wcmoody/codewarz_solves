We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
