I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
