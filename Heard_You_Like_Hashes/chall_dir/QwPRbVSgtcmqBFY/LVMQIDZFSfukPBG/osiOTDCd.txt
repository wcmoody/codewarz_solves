I put you high up in the sky
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
