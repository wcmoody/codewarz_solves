I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
And instead of using force
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
We jumped, never asking why
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
