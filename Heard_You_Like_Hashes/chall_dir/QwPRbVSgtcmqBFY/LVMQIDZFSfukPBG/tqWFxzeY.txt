All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I put you high up in the sky
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never meant to start a war
We jumped, never asking why
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
