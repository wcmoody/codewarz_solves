I put you high up in the sky
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, you’re not coming down
I never meant to start a war
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
A love no one could deny
And instead of using force
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
I guess I should’ve let you in
