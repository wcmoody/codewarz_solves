I never meant to start a war
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
