Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
