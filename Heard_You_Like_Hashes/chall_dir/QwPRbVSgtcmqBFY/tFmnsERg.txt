I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
