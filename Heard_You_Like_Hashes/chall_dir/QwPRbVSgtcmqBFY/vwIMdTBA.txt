And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
A love no one could deny
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
