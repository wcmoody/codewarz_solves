I never hit so hard in love
And now, you’re not coming down
I guess I should’ve let you in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We jumped, never asking why
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
