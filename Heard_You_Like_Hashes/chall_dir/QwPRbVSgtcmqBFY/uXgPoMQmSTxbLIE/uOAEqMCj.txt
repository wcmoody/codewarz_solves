We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
