We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
