I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And instead of using force
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
We jumped, never asking why
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
