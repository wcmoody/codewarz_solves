All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
