We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
