All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
