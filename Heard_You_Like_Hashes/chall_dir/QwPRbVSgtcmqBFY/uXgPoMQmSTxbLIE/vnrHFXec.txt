I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And instead of using force
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We jumped, never asking why
