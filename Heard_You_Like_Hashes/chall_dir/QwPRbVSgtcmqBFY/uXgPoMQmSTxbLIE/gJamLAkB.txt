I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
And now, you’re not coming down
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
