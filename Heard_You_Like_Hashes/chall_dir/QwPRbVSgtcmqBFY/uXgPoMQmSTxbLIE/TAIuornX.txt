I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I put you high up in the sky
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
