All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
A love no one could deny
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
