Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I put you high up in the sky
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
