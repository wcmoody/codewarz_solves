I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
