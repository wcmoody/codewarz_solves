I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
