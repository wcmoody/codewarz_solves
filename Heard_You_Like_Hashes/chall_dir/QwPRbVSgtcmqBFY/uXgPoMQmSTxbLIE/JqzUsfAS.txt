I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, you’re not coming down
And instead of using force
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
