I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
