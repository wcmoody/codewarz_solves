And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
And instead of using force
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
We kissed, I fell under your spell
