It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
