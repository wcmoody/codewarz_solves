I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And instead of using force
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I guess I shouldâ€™ve let you in
