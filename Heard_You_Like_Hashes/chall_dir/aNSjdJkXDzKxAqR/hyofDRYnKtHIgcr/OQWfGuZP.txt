And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
And instead of using force
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
