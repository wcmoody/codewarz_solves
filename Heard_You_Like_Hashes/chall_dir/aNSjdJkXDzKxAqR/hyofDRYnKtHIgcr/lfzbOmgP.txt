Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you wreck me
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
