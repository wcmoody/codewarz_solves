A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And instead of using force
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
