I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
