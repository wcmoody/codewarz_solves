I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
