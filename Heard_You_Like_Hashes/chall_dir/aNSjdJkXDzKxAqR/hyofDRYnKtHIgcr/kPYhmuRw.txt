All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
