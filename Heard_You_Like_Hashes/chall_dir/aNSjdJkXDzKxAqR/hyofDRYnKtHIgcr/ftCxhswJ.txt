I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
I will always want you
