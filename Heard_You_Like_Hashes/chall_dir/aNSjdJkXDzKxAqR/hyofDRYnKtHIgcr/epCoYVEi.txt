All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
I guess I should’ve let you in
I guess I should’ve let you in
We jumped, never asking why
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I just wanted you to let me in
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
And instead of using force
A love no one could deny
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
