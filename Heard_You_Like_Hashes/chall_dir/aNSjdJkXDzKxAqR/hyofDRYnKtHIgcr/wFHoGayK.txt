I never meant to start a war
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
It slowly turned, you let me burn
