I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I will always want you
