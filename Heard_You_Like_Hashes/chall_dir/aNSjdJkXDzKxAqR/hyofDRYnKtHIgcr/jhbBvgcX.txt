I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
