I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
