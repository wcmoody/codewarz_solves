And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
