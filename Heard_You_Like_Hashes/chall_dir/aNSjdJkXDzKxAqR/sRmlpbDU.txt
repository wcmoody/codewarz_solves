I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
