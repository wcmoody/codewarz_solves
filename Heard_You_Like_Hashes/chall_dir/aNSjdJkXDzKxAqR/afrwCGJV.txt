Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
