All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
