And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
