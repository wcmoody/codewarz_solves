A love no one could deny
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
