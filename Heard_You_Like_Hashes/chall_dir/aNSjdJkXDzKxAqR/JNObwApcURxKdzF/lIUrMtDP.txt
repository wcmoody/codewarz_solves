We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
