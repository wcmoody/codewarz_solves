I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I guess I should’ve let you in
And instead of using force
