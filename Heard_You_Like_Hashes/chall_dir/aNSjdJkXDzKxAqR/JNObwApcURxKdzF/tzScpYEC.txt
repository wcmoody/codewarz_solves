And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
