I never meant to start a war
And instead of using force
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
