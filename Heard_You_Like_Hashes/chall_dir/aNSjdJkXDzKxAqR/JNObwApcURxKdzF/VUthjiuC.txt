Yeah, you, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
