Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We jumped, never asking why
