I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
