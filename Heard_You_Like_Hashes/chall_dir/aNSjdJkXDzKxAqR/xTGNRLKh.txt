I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
