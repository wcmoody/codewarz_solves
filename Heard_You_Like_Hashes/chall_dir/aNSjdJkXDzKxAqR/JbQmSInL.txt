A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And instead of using force
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
