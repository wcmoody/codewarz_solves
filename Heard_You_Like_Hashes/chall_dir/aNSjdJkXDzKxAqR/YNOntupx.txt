I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
