I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And instead of using force
I never hit so hard in love
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I just wanted you to let me in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
