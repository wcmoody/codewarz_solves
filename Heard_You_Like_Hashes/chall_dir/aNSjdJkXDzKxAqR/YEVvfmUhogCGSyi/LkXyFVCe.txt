I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you wreck me
We jumped, never asking why
I put you high up in the sky
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
