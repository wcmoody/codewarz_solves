I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
A love no one could deny
And now, you’re not coming down
