Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I put you high up in the sky
