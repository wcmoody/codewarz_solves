I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
And instead of using force
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
