I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And instead of using force
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
