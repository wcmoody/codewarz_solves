All I wanted was to break your walls
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
