I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
