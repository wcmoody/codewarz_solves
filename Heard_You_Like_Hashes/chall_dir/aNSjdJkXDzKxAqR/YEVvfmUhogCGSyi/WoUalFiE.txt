I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
