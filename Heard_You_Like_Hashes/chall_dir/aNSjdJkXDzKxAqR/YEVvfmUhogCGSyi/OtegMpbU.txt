I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
