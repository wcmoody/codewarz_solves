And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
