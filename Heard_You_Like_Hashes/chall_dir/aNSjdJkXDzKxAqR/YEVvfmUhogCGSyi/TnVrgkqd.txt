All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
