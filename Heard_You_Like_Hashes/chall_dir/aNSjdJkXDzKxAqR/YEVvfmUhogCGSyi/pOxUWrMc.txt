Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
