I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And instead of using force
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I put you high up in the sky
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
