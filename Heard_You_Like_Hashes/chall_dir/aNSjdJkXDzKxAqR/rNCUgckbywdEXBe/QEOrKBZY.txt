Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
