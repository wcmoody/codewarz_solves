I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
