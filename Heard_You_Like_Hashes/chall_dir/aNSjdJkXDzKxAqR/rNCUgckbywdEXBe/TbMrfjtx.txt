I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I guess I should’ve let you in
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
