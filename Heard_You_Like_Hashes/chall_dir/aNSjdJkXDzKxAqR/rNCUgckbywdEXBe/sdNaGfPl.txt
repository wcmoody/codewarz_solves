I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
