Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
