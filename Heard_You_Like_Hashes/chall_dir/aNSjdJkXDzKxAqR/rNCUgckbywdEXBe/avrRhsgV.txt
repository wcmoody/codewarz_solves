I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
