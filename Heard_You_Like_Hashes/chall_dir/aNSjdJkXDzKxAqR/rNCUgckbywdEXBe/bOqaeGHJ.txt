I put you high up in the sky
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
