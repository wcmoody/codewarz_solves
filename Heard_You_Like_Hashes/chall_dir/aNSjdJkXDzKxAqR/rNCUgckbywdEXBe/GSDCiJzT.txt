I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
