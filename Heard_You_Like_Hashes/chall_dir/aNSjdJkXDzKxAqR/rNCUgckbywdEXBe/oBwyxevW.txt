I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
I guess I should’ve let you in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
