I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We jumped, never asking why
All I wanted was to break your walls
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
