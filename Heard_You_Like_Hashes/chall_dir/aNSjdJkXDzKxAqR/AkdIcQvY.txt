Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
A love no one could deny
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
