All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
