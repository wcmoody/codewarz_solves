I just wanted you to let me in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I will always want you
