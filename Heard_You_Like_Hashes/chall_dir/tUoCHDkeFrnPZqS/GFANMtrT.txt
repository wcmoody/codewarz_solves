I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never hit so hard in love
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
And now, you’re not coming down
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
And instead of using force
I will always want you
