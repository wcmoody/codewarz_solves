And now, you’re not coming down
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
