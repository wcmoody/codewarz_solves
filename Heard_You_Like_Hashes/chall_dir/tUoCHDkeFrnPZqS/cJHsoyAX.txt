Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I put you high up in the sky
I just wanted you to let me in
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
