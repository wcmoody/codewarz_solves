I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
