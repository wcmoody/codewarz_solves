Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I shouldâ€™ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
