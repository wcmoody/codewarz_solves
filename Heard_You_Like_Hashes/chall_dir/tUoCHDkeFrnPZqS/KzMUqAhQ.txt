All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And now, you’re not coming down
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
