Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
