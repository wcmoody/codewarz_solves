Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
I just wanted you to let me in
