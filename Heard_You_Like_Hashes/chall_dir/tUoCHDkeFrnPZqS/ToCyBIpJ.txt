I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
And instead of using force
