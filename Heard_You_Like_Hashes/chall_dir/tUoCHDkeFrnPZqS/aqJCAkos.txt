I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
