I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I put you high up in the sky
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
