Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
