All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I guess I should’ve let you in
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
A love no one could deny
I just wanted you to let me in
We jumped, never asking why
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
