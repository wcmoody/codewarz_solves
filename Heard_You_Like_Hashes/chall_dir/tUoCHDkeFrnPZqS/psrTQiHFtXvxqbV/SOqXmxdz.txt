I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never meant to start a war
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
