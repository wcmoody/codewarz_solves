I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
And instead of using force
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
