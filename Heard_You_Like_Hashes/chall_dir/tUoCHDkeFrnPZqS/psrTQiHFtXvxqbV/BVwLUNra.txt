We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
A love no one could deny
We jumped, never asking why
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
