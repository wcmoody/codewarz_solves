And instead of using force
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
