Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
And instead of using force
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
