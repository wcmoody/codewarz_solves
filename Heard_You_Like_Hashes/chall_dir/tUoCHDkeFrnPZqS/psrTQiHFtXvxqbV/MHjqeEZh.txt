I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
