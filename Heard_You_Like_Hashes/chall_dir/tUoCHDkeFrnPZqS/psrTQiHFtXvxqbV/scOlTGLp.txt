All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
