Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I put you high up in the sky
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
And instead of using force
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never meant to start a war
