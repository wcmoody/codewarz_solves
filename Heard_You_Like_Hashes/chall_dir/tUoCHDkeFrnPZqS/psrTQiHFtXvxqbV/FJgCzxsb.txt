Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
I put you high up in the sky
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
