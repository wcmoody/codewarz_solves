Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And instead of using force
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
