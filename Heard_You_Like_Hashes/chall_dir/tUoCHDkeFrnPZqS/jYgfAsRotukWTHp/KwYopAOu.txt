I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
I just wanted you to let me in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
