Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
