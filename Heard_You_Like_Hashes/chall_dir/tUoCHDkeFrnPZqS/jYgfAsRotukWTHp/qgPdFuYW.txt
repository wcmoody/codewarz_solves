I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
And now, weâ€™re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
