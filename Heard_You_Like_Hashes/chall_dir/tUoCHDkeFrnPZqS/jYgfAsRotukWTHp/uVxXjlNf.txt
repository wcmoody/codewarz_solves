I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
