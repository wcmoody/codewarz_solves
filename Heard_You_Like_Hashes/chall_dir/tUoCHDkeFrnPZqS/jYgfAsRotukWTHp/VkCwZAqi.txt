And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
