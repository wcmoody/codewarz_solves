Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
A love no one could deny
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
