And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I will always want you
And instead of using force
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
