All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And instead of using force
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
