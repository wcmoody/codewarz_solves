Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And now, you’re not coming down
