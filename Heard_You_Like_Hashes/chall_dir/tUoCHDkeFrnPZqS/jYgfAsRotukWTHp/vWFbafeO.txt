Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
We kissed, I fell under your spell
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
