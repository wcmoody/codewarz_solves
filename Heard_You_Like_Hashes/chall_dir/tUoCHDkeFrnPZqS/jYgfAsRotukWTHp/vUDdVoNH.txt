I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I put you high up in the sky
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
