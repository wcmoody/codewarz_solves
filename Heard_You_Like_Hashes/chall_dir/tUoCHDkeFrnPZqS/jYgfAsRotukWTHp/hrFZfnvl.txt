I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I put you high up in the sky
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
