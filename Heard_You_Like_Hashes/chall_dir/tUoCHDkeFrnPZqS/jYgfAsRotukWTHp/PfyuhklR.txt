And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
