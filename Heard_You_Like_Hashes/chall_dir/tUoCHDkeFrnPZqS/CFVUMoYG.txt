I never hit so hard in love
A love no one could deny
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
