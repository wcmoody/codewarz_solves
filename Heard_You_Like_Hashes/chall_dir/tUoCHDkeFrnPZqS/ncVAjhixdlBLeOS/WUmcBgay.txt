I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
