I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
