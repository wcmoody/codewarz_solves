Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
