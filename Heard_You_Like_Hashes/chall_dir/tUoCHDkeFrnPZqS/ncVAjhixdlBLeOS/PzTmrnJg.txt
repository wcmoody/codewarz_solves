Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I just wanted you to let me in
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And instead of using force
And now, you’re not coming down
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
