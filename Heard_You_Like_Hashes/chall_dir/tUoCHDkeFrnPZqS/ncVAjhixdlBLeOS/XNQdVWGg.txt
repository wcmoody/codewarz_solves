Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
