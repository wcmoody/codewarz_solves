Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
