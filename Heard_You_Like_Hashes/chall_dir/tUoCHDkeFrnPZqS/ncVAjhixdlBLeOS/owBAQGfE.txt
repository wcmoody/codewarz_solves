I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
