I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
All I wanted was to break your walls
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
