All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
