I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
