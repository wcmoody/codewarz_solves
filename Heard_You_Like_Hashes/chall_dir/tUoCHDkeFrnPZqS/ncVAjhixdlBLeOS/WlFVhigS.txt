I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
I put you high up in the sky
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
And instead of using force
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
A love no one could deny
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
