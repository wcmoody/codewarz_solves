I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I guess I should’ve let you in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
