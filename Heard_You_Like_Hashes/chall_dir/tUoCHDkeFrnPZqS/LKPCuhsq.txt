All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
