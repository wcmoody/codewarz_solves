Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
A love no one could deny
We jumped, never asking why
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, you’re not coming down
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I will always want you
