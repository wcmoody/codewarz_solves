All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And now, you’re not coming down
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
