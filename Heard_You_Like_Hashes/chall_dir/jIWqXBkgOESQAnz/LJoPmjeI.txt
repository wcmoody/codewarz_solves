I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never hit so hard in love
And instead of using force
