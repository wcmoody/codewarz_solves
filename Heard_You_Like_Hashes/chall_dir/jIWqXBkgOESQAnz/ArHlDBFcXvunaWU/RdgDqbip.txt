All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
