And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
