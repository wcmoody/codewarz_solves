I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
And instead of using force
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
It slowly turned, you let me burn
