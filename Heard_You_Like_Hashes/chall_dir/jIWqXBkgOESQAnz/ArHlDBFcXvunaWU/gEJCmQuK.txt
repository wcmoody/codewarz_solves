Yeah, you, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
