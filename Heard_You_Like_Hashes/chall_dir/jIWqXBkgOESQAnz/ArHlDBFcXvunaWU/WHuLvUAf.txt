Yeah, you, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never meant to start a war
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
