I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
Donâ€™t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
