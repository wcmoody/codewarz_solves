I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
