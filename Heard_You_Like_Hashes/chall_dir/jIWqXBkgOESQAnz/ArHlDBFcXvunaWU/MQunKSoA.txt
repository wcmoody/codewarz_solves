All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was break me
And now, you’re not coming down
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
