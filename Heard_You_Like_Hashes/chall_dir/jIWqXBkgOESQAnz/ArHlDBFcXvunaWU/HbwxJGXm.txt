I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
