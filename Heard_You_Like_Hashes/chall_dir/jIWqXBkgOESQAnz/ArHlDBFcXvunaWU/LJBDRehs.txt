I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We jumped, never asking why
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
