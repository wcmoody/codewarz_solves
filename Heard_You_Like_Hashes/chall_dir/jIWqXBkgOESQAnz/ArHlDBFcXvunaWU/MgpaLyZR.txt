Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
I put you high up in the sky
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
