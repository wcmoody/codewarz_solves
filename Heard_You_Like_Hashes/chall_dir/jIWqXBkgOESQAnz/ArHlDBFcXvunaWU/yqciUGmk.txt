Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
I will always want you
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
