Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And instead of using force
