I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I put you high up in the sky
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
