All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never meant to start a war
And now, you’re not coming down
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We jumped, never asking why
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
I just wanted you to let me in
