I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
