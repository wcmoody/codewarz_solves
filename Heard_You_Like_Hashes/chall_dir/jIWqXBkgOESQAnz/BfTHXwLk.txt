Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, you’re not coming down
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
A love no one could deny
