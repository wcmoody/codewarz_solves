I guess I should’ve let you in
I guess I should’ve let you in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
And instead of using force
