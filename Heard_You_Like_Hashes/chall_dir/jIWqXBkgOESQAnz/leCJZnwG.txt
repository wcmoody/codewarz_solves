I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
And now, you’re not coming down
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And instead of using force
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
