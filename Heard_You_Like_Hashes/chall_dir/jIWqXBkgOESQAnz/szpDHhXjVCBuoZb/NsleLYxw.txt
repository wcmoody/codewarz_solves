I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
And instead of using force
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
