We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
