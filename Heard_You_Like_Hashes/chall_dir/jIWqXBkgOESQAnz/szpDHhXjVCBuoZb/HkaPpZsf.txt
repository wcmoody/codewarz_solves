We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, you’re not coming down
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
