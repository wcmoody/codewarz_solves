I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I guess I should’ve let you in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
And now, you’re not coming down
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And instead of using force
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
