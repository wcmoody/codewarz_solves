Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I put you high up in the sky
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I guess I should’ve let you in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
