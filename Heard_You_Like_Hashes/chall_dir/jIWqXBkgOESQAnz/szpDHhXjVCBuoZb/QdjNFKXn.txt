I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
We jumped, never asking why
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
