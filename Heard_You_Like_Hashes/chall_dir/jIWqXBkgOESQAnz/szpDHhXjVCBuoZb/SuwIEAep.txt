I put you high up in the sky
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
It slowly turned, you let me burn
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All I wanted was to break your walls
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never meant to start a war
