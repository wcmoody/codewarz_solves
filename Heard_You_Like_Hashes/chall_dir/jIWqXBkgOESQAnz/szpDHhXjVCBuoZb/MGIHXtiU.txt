We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
