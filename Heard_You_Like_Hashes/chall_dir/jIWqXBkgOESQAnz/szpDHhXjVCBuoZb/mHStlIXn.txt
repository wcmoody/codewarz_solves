Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I put you high up in the sky
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
And instead of using force
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
