And now, you’re not coming down
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I never hit so hard in love
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
And instead of using force
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
