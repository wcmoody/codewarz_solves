Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
It slowly turned, you let me burn
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
We jumped, never asking why
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I just wanted you to let me in
