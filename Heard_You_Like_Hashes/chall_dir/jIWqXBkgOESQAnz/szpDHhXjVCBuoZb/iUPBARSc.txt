Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
We jumped, never asking why
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
