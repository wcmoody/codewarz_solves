All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
