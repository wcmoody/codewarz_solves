Yeah, you, you wreck me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I put you high up in the sky
I guess I should’ve let you in
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you wreck me
And instead of using force
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
