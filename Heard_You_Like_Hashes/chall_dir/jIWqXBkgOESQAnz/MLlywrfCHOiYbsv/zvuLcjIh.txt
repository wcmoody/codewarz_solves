Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
And instead of using force
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I will always want you
I will always want you
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
