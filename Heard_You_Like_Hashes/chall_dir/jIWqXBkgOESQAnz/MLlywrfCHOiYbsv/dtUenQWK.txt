I will always want you
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
A love no one could deny
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
And now, you’re not coming down
We jumped, never asking why
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
I guess I should’ve let you in
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
