Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, you’re not coming down
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
