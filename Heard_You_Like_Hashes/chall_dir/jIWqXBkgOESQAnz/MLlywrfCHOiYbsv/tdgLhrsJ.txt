I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I guess I should’ve let you in
A love no one could deny
We jumped, never asking why
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
