All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I just wanted you to let me in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
