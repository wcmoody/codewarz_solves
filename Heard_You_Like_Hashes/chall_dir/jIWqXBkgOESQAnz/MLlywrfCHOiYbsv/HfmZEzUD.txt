I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I never meant to start a war
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
All you ever did was break me
I will always want you
I will always want you
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
All I wanted was to break your walls
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And instead of using force
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
