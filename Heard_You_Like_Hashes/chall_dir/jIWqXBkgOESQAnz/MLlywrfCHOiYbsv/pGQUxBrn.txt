I came in like a wrecking ball
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
A love no one could deny
I never hit so hard in love
I guess I should’ve let you in
All I wanted was to break your walls
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
And now, you’re not coming down
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
Yeah, you wreck me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
