All you ever did was break me
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I put you high up in the sky
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
And now, you’re not coming down
