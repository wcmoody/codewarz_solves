Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
I just wanted you to let me in
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Yeah, you wreck me
