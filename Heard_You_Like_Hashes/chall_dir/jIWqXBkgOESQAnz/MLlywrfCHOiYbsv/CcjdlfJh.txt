All you ever did was break me
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
All I wanted was to break your walls
A love no one could deny
I never meant to start a war
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I just wanted you to let me in
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, you’re not coming down
I came in like a wrecking ball
We kissed, I fell under your spell
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never hit so hard in love
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
All you ever did was break me
