I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never meant to start a war
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
A love no one could deny
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I just wanted you to let me in
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I never meant to start a war
All you ever did was break me
I put you high up in the sky
I came in like a wrecking ball
It slowly turned, you let me burn
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I just wanted you to let me in
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
And instead of using force
