And instead of using force
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I put you high up in the sky
I just wanted you to let me in
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, you, you wreck me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
We jumped, never asking why
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All I wanted was to break your walls
I never hit so hard in love
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
And now, you’re not coming down
I will always want you
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I just wanted you to let me in
Yeah, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never meant to start a war
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, you, you wreck me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I will always want you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never hit so hard in love
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, you wreck me
A love no one could deny
All you ever did was break me
