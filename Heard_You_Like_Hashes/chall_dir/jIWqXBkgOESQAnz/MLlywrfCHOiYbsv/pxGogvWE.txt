Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I put you high up in the sky
All I wanted was to break your walls
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I guess I should’ve let you in
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
