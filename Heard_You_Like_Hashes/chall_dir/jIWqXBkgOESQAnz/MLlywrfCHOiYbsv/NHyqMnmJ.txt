I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
We kissed, I fell under your spell
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
And instead of using force
I just wanted you to let me in
A love no one could deny
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
