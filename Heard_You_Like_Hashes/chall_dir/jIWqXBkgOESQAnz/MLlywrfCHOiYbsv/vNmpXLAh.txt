I guess I should’ve let you in
All you ever did was break me
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, you wreck me
I never hit so hard in love
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
I will always want you
I never meant to start a war
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
We kissed, I fell under your spell
I will always want you
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you in
I will always want you
We jumped, never asking why
Yeah, you wreck me
All I wanted was to break your walls
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
All you ever did was break me
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
