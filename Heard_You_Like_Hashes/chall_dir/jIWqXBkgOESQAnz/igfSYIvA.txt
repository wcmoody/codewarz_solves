All you ever did was break me
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Yeah, you wreck me
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I never meant to start a war
We kissed, I fell under your spell
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
I just wanted you to let me in
And now, you’re not coming down
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
It slowly turned, you let me burn
I will always want you
All you ever did was break me
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
I guess I should’ve let you in
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Yeah, you, you wreck me
All you ever did was break me
A love no one could deny
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, you wreck me
I will always want you
I never hit so hard in love
I came in like a wrecking ball
All you ever did was break me
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I came in like a wrecking ball
I came in like a wrecking ball
We jumped, never asking why
All I wanted was to break your walls
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I will always want you
I put you high up in the sky
And instead of using force
I came in like a wrecking ball
All I wanted was to break your walls
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
I never meant to start a war
