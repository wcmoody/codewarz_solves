# Description

<p>The path to the input file will be passed into your program as a command line argument when your program is called.<br/><br/>
From a keyboard capture of a MUD player. Determine what floor level the player was at. U is up two floors, u is up one floor, MH is up six floors, mh is up three floors, D is down two floors, d is down one floor, SL is down six floors, sl is down 3 floors. Can you tell what floor the MUD player was at from his keyboard capture, also take note he starts from the ground floor? Sometimes he spills MT Dew and doritos on his keyboard, just ignore the keys pressed while cleaning up his mess.
