# Choosy_Haxors_Choose_Gif

# Description

<p>You've found some super cool images online (who doesn't love an animated gif?) but after staring at them for several hours in a Red Bull induced haze you realize that they are trying to tell you something.... Maybe it is a method that someone is using to pass information around while keeping the picture aesthetically pleasing! Decode the images and print the flag that you find. Keep in mind that you will not be able to save anything locally when trying to solve any problem.
