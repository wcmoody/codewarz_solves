# Pacman_puckman

# Description

<p>After playing various games of Pacman while fueled by RC Cola and Rick Astley melodies, you decide to start looking up other people's pacman scores.
Knowing the point breakdown for Pacman and assuming that each level completed is a perfect level (240 dots eaten, all 4 power pellets eaten, all 4 ghosts eaten per energizer (only for levels 1-16 and 18), and both fruit eaten per level), determine the players highest level attained and print it out. Remember that the ghosts do not blink (cannot be eaten and receive points for eating them) in level 17 and 19 and up.<br/>
